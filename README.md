# Green-yellow-Graph
This is a demo project to showcase the use of graphs, recursion and famous algorithms (DFS, BFS).

A graph is green-yellow colorable if two connected nodes never have the same color, and the graph is a connected graph!

To run the project:

npm install ( you can do npm install --force if needed)

npm run start
